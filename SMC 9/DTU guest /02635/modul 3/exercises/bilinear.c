/* bilinear.c
extension of line.c program in which the function g(t) is approximated using
the bilinear interpolation in order to approximate the line integral.

obs:
- the user has to prompt the grid dimension M,N;
- the function values at the grid point to compute the bilinear integration
  are stored and precomputed at the beginning of the program
