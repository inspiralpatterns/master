## Introduction to the folder

In this folder, several writings take place, such as papers, reports etc.
All of them have been written throughout the master programme in order to fulfill the examination criteria for the so-called
*semester projects*. They are indeed predominant within the master programme, being 15 ECTS each of them on a total of 30 ECTS
each semester. 

Each writing comes with specific additional works, e.g. scripts, slides, A/V productions, which are stored in other repositories.
For instance [this repository](https://github.com/thisisjl/smc-AARG) contains the whole work corresponding to the paper named
*smc7.pdf*. Some other repositories are private though.

**ADDITIONAL NOTES**
- the writing *mps.pdf* corresponds to the work made by me and a fellow student of mine, Diego Di Carlo, for the final assessment on the master programme's course *Modelling physical systems* given in Spring 2016. For code and scripts, refer to the specific folder;
- the writing *MML16.pdf* corresponds to the paper submitted for the 9th International workshop on Machine Learning and Music, held in Riva del Garda (IT) on September, 23rd - [here](https://sites.google.com/site/musicmachinelearning16/) for details.
