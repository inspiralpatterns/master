# master portfolio

## General information
Here are some material from my M.S. in Engineering *Sound and Music Computing* at AAlborg Universitet, Kobehnavn. The master spans a time period from September, 2015 to June, 2017.

The course material range from basics of statistics (*Multivariate Statistics and Pattern Recognition*), programming (the SMC 9 folder, as guest student at *DTU*, Technical University of Denmark) and audio signal processing topics (*Sound and signal Music Analysis*). 

This is intended as a partial demonstration of the covered topics, acquired skills and objectives of the courses within the master programme.

Together with the courses (either named with their number or with their acronym), here all the project I've done take place.
All these projects are group-based projects except the last one, which can be found in the folder named SMC 9. 

Finally, the folder SMC 10 contains the work that I have produced in the committment for my master's thesis.


### Main structure
This folder is structured as such:

1. Each semester has a separate folder
2. Semesters start from SMC 7
3. Semester SMC 9 contains the courses I took during as guest student at DTU (Fall 2016)
4. Semecter SMC 10 contains the master's thesis

*DISCLAIMER*: I do not own the rights for any of the lecture slide, and any of the paper neither. 
All information about Authors, teachers and coordinators name could be found on the specific Universities websites.

## Overview

### SMC 7
This folder contains:
- Multivariate Statistics and Pattern Recognition (mostly *Matlab*)
- Sound processing (only the exam project, mainly *Cycling '74 Max*)
- main project (only an internal report and some Matlab script. For the whole code a separate repository exists. See article in /paper)

### SMC 8
This folder contains:
- Interaction performance (only the exam project, mainly in *C++* and Cycling '74 *Max*)
- Sound and Signal Music Analysis (only the exam project in *Matlab*)
- Modelling physical Systems (only the exam project, mainly in *Matlab*)

### SMC 9
This folder contains:
- 02632 | Introduction to programming and Data Processing (in *Matlab*, August 2016, DTU)
- 02635 | Mathematical Software Programming (in *C/C++*, Fall 2016, DTU)
- 02393 | Programming in C++ (Fall 2016, DTU)
- Project | scripts and data set for the semester project (see report in /papers)

### SMC 10
This folder contains the master's thesis, named *Timbre modification using deep learning*. The main aim of the work is to create a model, which can learn a code function describing the mapping between an input single tone and a *targeted* single tone in an end-to-end fashion.

### papers
This folder contains the writings that I have been written in collaboration with some fellow students throughout the master programme in order to fulfill the examination criteria for the so-called *semester projects*.
