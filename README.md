# master portfolio

## General information
Here are some material from some of the courses I have been enrolled during my M.Sc. in **Sound and Music Computing** 
at AAlborg Universitet, Kobehnavn.

The selected courses range from basics of statistics (*Multivariate Statistics and Pattern Recognition*, Fall 2015), programming
in several languages (e.g. Matlab, C/C++ and specifically, the Fall 2016 semester as guest student at DTU, Technical University of 
Denmark) and audio signal processing topics (*Sound and signal Music Analysis, Spring 2016). 

Some of them are still in progress, and this is intended as a partial demonstration of the covered topics, acquired skills and objectives
of the courses within the master programme. The repository will be therefore constantly updated.

Together with the courses (either named with their number or with their acronym), here all the project I've done take place.
All these projects are group-based projects except the last one, namely SMC9.


### Main structure
This folder is structured as such:

1. Each semester has a separate folder
2. Semesters start from SMC 7
3. Semester SMC 9 contains the courses I took during as guest student at DTU (Fall 2016)
4. Semester SMC 10 is missing (will begin in February, working on the Master Thesis)

**DISCLAIMER**: I do not own the rights for any of the lecture slide, and any of the paper neither. 
All information about Authors, teachers and coordinators name could be found on the specific Universities websites.

## Overview

### SMC 7
This folder contains:
- Multivariate Statistics and Pattern Recognition (mainly in *Matlab*)
- Sound processing (only the exam project, mainly *Cycling '74 Max*)
- main project (only an internal report and some Matlab script. For the whole code a separate repository exists. See article in /paper)

### SMC 8
This folder contains:
- Interaction performance (only the exam project, mainly in *C++* and Cycling '74 *Max*)
- Sound and Signal Music Analysis (only the exam project in *Matlab*, more code will be added from the next month)
- a very first contract of the main project. (For the whole code a separate repository exists. See report in /papers)
- Modelling physical Systems (only the exam project, mainly in *Matlab*)

### SMC 9
This folder contains:
- 02632 | Introduction to programming and Data Processing (in *Matlab*, August 2016, DTU)
- 02635 | Mathematical Software Programming (in *C*, Fall 2016, DTU)
- 02393 | Programming in C++ (Fall 2016, DTU)
- Project | scripts and data set for the semester project (see report in /papers)

### papers
This folder contains the writings that I have been written in collaboration with some fellow students throughout the master programme in order to fulfill the examination criteria for the so-called *semester projects*.
